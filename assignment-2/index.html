        <h4>Degree: A.S. </h4>


        <p>The Multimedia Programming and Design Program prepares students for careers in a variety of multimedia
          industries, companies and institutions that develop, produce or market multimedia products, programs or
          services. The program instructs students in the design and programming of computer-based interactive
          products that incorporate text, graphics, sound, animation and video. It also develops different types
          of talent, both creative and technical, with the imperative that each understands the work of the other
          so that they can collaborate effectively.</p>

          <p>Upon successful completion of the curriculum, students are awarded an Associate in Science degree (A.S.)
             and may transfer to senior institutions such as York, NYU or New York City College of Technology.</p>

          <h3> <font color="#bf5f82">Transfer Option</font> </h3>
          <p>BMCC has articulation agreements with CUNY NYC College of Technology to
            allow you to seamlessly continue your education there
            without any loss of credits. </p>
